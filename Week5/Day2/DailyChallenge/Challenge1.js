// Create an array using forEach that contains all the usernames from the gameInfo array, add an exclamation point (ie. “!”) to the end of every username.
// The new array should look like this :
//     const usernames = ["john!", "becky!", "susy!", "tyson!"]
// 2. Create an array using forEach that contains the usernames of all players with a score bigger than 5.
// The new array should look like this :
//     const winners = ["becky", "susy"]
// 3. Find and display the total score of the users. (Hint: The total score is 71)
