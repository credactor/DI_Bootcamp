// 1. Create a class named Video. The class should be constructed with the following parameters:
//     title (a string) 
//     uploader (a string, the person who uploaded it) 
//     time (a number, the duration of the video - in seconds) 
// 2. Create a method called watch() which displays a string as follows:
//     “uploader parameter watched all time parameter of title parameter!” 
// 3. Instantiate a new Video instance and call the watch() method. 
// 4. Instantiate a second Video instance with different values. 
// 5. Bonus: Use an array to store data for five Video instances (ie. title, uploader, time)
//     Think of the best data structure to save this information within the array. 
// 6. Bonus: Loop through the array to instantiate those instances. 

class Video {
    constructor(title, uploader, time) {
        this.title = title;
        this.uploader = uploader;
        this.time = time;
    }
    watch() {
        console.log (`${this.uploader} watched all ${this.time} minutes of ${this.title}!`);
    }
}

movie1 = new Video ("Titanic", "James", 230);
movie1.watch();
