# Exercise: Bank Account Management System
# Overview
# You will create an BankAccount class that represents a bank account with advanced features. This class will manage different account types, track transactions, and include more complex class methods for account management.
# Requirements
# 1. Class Attributes and Methods: 
# 2. The class should keep track of the total number of bank accounts created and maintain a list of all accounts. 
# 3. Implement a class method to find an account by its account number. 
# 4. Implement a class method to summarize total balances across all accounts.
# 5. Instance Attributes and Methods:
# 6. Use a @property to manage access to the account balance. 
# 7. Use a @property and @setter to handle and validate the account type. 
# 8. Include a transaction history that logs deposits and withdrawals. 
# 9. Implement a method to calculate and add interest to the account balance (specific to savings accounts). 
# 10. Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing money, with validation checks. 
# Implementation Details
# 1. Class Attributes: 
# 2. total_accounts: Tracks the total number of bank accounts created. 
# 3. all_accounts: A list that stores references to all BankAccount instances. 
# 4. interest_rate: A class attribute to define the default interest rate for savings accounts.
# 5. Class Methods:
# 6. get_total_accounts(cls): Returns the total number of accounts. 
# 7. find_account_by_number(cls, account_number): Finds and returns an account by its account number. 
# 8. total_balances(cls): Returns the sum of balances across all accounts.
# 9. Properties:
# 10. balance: Provides access to the account balance. 
# 11. account_type: Manages the type of account with validation logic. 
# 12. transaction_history: A list that logs all transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
# 13. Methods:
# 14. deposit(amount): Adds money to the account and logs the transaction. 
# 15. withdraw(amount): Withdraws money, ensuring the balance doesnâ€™t go negative, and logs the transaction. 
# 16. apply_interest(): Applies interest to savings accounts.
# Tasks to Complete
# 1. Create the BankAccount class with the provided class and instance attributes. 
# 2. Implement class methods to manage and interact with the accounts collectively. 
# 3. Implement the @property and @setter for the account balance and account type. 
# 4. Track transaction history within each account. 
# 5. Test your class by creating multiple accounts, performing various transactions, and applying interest. 
# Expected Output
# When you run the example usage:
# The account balances should update correctly based on deposits, withdrawals, and interest application. 
# The total number of accounts created and total balances should be tracked and displayed accurately. 
# The find_account_by_number method should correctly identify accounts by their unique account number. 
# The transaction history for each account should log all actions taken.
