# You are given a dictionary containing student names as keys and lists of their grades as values. Your task is to create a summary report that calculates the average grade for each student, assigns a letter grade, and determines the class average.
# Requirements:
#     Calculate the average grade for each student and store the results in a new dictionary called student_averages.
#     Assign each student a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on their average grade according to the following scale, and store the results in a dictionary called student_letter_grades:
#         A: 90 and above
#         B: 80 to 89
#         C: 70 to 79
#         D: 60 to 69
#         F: Below 60
#     Calculate the class average (the average of all studentsâ€™ averages) and print it.
#     Print the name of each student, their average grade, and their letter grade.

# Hints:
#     Use loops to iterate through the student_grades dictionary.
#     You may use sum() and len() functions to help calculate averages.
#     Initialize empty dictionaries for student_averages and student_letter_grades before filling them with data.
